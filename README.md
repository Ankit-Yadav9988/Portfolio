# Portfolio
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The portfolio showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as a full-stack developer. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, the site features a modern design with responsive layouts, smooth animations, and interactive elements.
